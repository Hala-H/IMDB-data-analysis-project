CS 3072 Final Project 

## Abstract
Films are an industry, pieces of art, and an important field that fills people with happiness and joy. Hundreds of films in a variety of genres are produced each year, however, not all films are successful. Data mining technology is the process of applying computational methods to large amounts of data in order to reveal new non-trivial and relevant information. This fantastic technology increases the chances of the film being a hit. The purpose of our study is to take this technology and apply it to data gathered from IMDb using the R programming language, in order to generate findings that illustrate to some extent some of the features that contribute to the film's excellence and success. After analysis and forecasting, it was concluded that based on basic cinematic characteristics, it is feasible to forecast a film's popularity. A reliable, parsimonious, multi-variable, linear regression model was developed in this study, and it was found to be capable of predicting movie popularity as indicated by the IMDB movie rating score.
